# tBilby

The tBilby package is a trans-dimensional Bayesian inference tool based on the user-friendly Bilby inference package. 
tBilby provides a set of tools and examples to facilitate trans-dimensional Bayesian inference. 
It offers a high degree of flexibility in constructing models and defining priors. 
Its goal is to extend its capabilities and further develop trans-dimensional Bayesian inference (arXiv:2404.04460).
