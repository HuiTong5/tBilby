The tbilby package is a trans-dimensional Bayesian inference tool based on the user-friendly Bilby inference package. 
tbilby provides a set of tools and examples to facilitate the rapid and straightforward setup of trans-dimensional Bayesian inference. 
It offers a high degree of flexibility in constructing models and defining priors. 
Its goal is to extend its capabilities and further develop trans-dimensional Bayesian inference (arXiv:XXXX.XXXXX).
